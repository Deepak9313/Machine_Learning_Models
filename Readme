We are going to start the Machine Learning Models 
We will deal in
1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised Learning
3) Reinforcement Learning
4) Semi Supervised Learning
5) Deep Learning Models
6) Ensemble Models
7) Anomaly Detection Models
8) Time Series Models
9) Probalistic Models

We are starting from the start 
We use virtual environment of python for developing the Models

--command for virtual environment
 py -m venv myvirtualenv

 --command for activating the virtual environment
    myvirtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
                or
    myvirtualenv\Scripts\activate
